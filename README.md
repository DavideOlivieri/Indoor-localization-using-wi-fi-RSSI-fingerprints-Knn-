# Indoor-localization-using-wi-fi-RSSI-fingerprints-Knn-

This project, developed during my internship in an Italian company, aims to explore the feasibility of using Wi-Fi technology for localization, focusing particularly on the organized retail sector. \
Wi-Fi represents an interesting solution due to its widespread availability, although specific integrations will be necessary to achieve an adequate level of accuracy, considering that this technology was not originally designed for this purpose.
